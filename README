This is plugins and behaviors to integrate the Google Game API into Construct2.

Installation Infomation Pulled from https://www.scirra.com/manual/69/plugins

To install a third party plugin:

1. Close Construct 2
2. Copy the plugin's folder to <install path>\exporters\html5\plugins. You'll see each plugin has its own folder here, so to add a new plugin create a new folder and add the plugin's files inside it. For behaviors, copy to <install path>\exporters\html5\behaviors instead.
3. Launch Construct 2 and the plugin or behavior should be available from the editor.
